The main purpose of this application was to introduce some new elements I had learned while making applications. 

The first element is Menus. Adding menus to this application gave me the versatility to add notes and expand the use of the application.

The next element that I worked on was SharedPreferences. Using shared preferences to store the contents of the application to be loaded when launching it for the first time was an element I did not at first understand. After using the application for adding a note and having the ability to edit the note, I wanted the notes I created to be there the next time I used the app, and that's where SharedPreferences was the most helpful.
